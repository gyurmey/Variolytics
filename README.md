# Variolytic 

## Code and tools or libraries used

Components folder contains all the seperate components and you can find the dummy data for charts in Utils folder. I used bootstrap for UI and react-i18next for language translation. For Chart, i used react-chartjs-2. To simulate real time data, i used setInterval function to add more dummy data. For login, currently there is no proper security but a basic validation where you need to input proper email format. Same goes for Profile page form and password change form, it only does basic validation. For Profile page, you can click on the person icon on the top right where you can also find a button for logout which takes you to the login page.
